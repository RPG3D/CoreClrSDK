# BuildCoreClrSDK.sh — build CoreCLR + BCL from dotnet/runtime source and populate the
# SDK platform directory.
#
# Usage:
#   ./BuildCoreClrSDK.sh <dotnet-runtime-dir> <platform> [build-type] [arch]
#
# Arguments:
#   dotnet-runtime-dir  Path to the dotnet/runtime repository clone
#   platform            android | ios | iossimulator
#                       Only the platforms UnrealSharp actually consumes are listed:
#                       desktop runs the upstream hostfxr host and needs no SDK.
#   build-type          Debug (default) | Release
#   arch                arm64 (default) | x64
#                       x64 is only meaningful for iossimulator.
#
# Output layout (same convention as MonoSDK/<Platform>/<arch>/):
#   Android/arm64/  IOS/arm64/  IOSSimulator/arm64/
#     lib/       native runtime + interop libraries
#     runtime/   BCL managed assemblies
#     VERSION.txt
#
# The build subset comes from DotNetRuntime.version (BUILD_SUBSET) — a single source of
# truth shared with CI and CopySDKFromSrc.sh. Adding subsets here and in the workflow
# separately is exactly how the two drifted apart before.
#
# Examples:
#   ./BuildCoreClrSDK.sh ~/dotnet-runtime android        Release
#   ./BuildCoreClrSDK.sh ~/dotnet-runtime ios            Release
#   ./BuildCoreClrSDK.sh ~/dotnet-runtime iossimulator   Release
